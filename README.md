# landing-page

This is a project where I will attempt to replicate the referenced material.

I tried my best and It looks ok at least to me.

I got the background video idea from Criosyoms website so check it out on the odin landpage projects page. His is really good.

The website lacks respinsiveness and will litterly break if pushed down, hopefully in the futre I can fix this.
